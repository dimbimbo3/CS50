# CS50
This repository serves as an archive of the work (Practice Problems, Labs, Problem Sets) I have completed for Harvard's free online xCS50 2023 course. I chose to follow along with this course in order to strengthen my fundamentals in, as well as further develop my skills with C in particular. To that end, I opted not to use the cs50 library for any of the assignments in C.
