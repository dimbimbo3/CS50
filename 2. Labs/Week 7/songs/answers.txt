If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?: The energy is above average with ~66%, 
the valence is slightly below average with ~48%, and the danceability is slightly higher above average with ~72%. With this all in mind, I can only guess that their audio aura
would be characterized as either Purple or Orange.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This may not be representative of the listener because the 3 given averages seem to indicate the they enjoy high energy music, that is rather danceable, but somehow 
also has sadness and anger to it (which would not typically be associated with songs of the former traits). Given this, I believe that the key, tempo, and speechiness of songs 
should also be accounted to better seperate thrilling dance music from loud yet depressing alternative tunes, as well as layered instrumentals that lack any vocalization 
but have significant complexity. Factoring in these additions would likely paint a better picture in regards to what feeling the listener was truly after.
